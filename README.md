SpreeDiscountShipping
=============

Apply discounts to shipping methods in Spree Commerce.

### Features

* Easily set shipping discounts on new and existing shipping methods through the Spree admin GUI.
* Shipping amounts are calculated with: `calculator_cost * (100 - discount)/100.0`. This can be adjusted [here](#).
* Easily set default shipping discounts that apply to all shipping methods.
* All existing shipping methods default to a 0% discount.
* No modifications to any of your `Spree::Calculator` classes are required--even if those classes are custom.
